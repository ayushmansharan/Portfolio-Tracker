## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Java 17+ (for backend)
- MySQL (for database)

### Setup Instructions
#### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/portfolio-tracker.git
cd portfolio-tracker
```

#### 2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Configure `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/portfolio_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=password
   ```
3. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

#### 3. Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint           | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| GET    | `/stocks`         | Get all stocks |
| POST   | `/stocks`         | Add a new stock |

### Assumptions & Limitations
- Users are assigned 5 random stocks for their portfolio.
- Each stock's quantity is assumed to be 1.
- Only basic authentication is implemented (optional for now).
- The stock price API has rate limits that may affect real-time updates.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and multi-user support.
- Improve real-time data fetching with WebSockets.
- Support for multiple stock exchanges and currencies.
